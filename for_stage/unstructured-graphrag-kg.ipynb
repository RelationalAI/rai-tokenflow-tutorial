The notebook involves:\n- Configuration Loading: Create a configuration for your project\n- Pipeline Invocation: Execute corresponding pipeline steps using direct calls throught the Python Snowflake Connector.\n- Visualization: Generate and display the Knowledge Graph visualization.\n\n**Note:** In this notebook, we demonstrate only the basic pipeline execution. However, the application also supports fine-tuning one of the available Cortex LLMs on your own documents. For the purposes of this demo, we use the default LLMs for both the extraction and question answering steps.\n\n**Alternative Workflow:** If you have already ran the pipeline through the UI, you can use this notebook by skipping the initial sections related to pipeline execution. Instead, go directly to the *'Load extracted graph data from Snowflake'* section. This allows you to proceed straight to the visualization phase."
