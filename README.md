# Running the Tokenflow Use Cases

The [GenAI for the AI Engineer: Tokenflow Use Case](genai-tokenflow.md) guide describes the four use cases on the Tokenflow data. More specifically, we go over the following use cases:

* Building a Knowledge Graph over Structured Data.
* Building a Knowledge Graph over Unstructured Data using GraphRAG.
* Predicting Transfer Transactions using GNNs.
* Detecting Anomalies.


To set up all the necessary data, tables, schemas, etc. for the use cases you will need to go through the [installation guide](installation.md). Once this is completed you are able to run the Python Notebooks that were installed as part of the process.
